# WLRS

First time trying to make a "full stack" web application. Goal is to track workouts


## TODO

- [ ] Make impl for WorkoutEntry so we can parse after retrieving from DB
- [ ] HTML + CSS Templating
- [ ] Switch from sqlite DB once stuff is working great. (Using sqlite because my dev environment changes frequently)
